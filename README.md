# Jungle

A mini e-commerce application built with Rails 4.2.
This project simulates real-world scenarios where developers may have to jump on an existing codebase as opposed to building a 
program from scratch. The assignment gave students the opportunity to challenge themselves by learning a new language on the fly
and using methods such as Error-Driven-Development to progress and learn. 

## Getting Started

1. Run `bundle install` to install dependencies
2. Run `bin/rake db:reset` to create, load and seed db

5. Put Stripe (test) keys into appropriate .env vars
